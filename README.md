# Operations_Research
A repository for Operations Research class at ECU and a place to submit our chapters for creating an open source text book for the course!

## Building The Book
To build the book, I worked at the office using GitHub Desktop.  I compiled it from Anaconda command line with "jupyter-book build "C:\Users\njacob\OneDrive - East Central University\Documents\GitHub\Operations_Research""  Then I took the contents of the html directory and put them into docs.  Push that back up and your site should update.  The command might have to be "jupyter-book build --all "C:\Users\njacob\OneDrive - East Central University\Documents\GitHub\Operations_Research"" to get it to look at **all** of the files.
